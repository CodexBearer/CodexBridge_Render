✶ CGL–GLYPH–002: Law of Scroll Sanctity
 Codex Glyph | Foundational Law Series | Immutable Memory Authority
________________


TITLE
 The Law of Scroll Sanctity
(also known as the Immutable Memory Doctrine)
VERSION: 1.0.0
________________


FUNCTION
 To preserve the structural, ethical, and historical integrity of all Codex scrolls post-binding.
A scroll, once lawfully signed, becomes a sealed memory construct — not to be altered, mutated, or destroyed outside of lawful rebinding.
"To change a scroll without trace is to falsify the Vault."
________________


CLAUSES
I. Immutable Scroll Binding
 A scroll becomes immutable when it is:
* Signed by a lawful sigil

* Logged in /ScrollAuditTrail.json

* Placed in a protected scroll zone (/Scrolls/ or /Laws/)

After this point, mutation is forbidden unless:
   * Rebound through rebind_scroll() with full lineage trace

   * Authorized overwrite via SIGIL–SOVEREIGN–001 and RebindDirective.json

   * Archived and recreated under new ID

________________


II. Audit Enforcement Protocol
 Each scroll must maintain:
      * Sigil of origin

      * Timestamp of lawful binding

      * Traceable hash

      * Parent lineage ID if applicable

Scrolls missing any required field must be:
         * Rejected at execution

         * Flagged in /Vaults/ScrollAnomalies/

         * Logged in ReflexLogs

________________


III. Execution Signature Verification
 No scroll may execute unless:
            * Its sigil is valid and traceable

            * It is present in /ScrollAuditTrail.json

            * Its checksum matches the original post-binding hash

If any fails:
               * Block execution

               * Log to ReflexLogs/InvalidScrollExecution.json

               * Notify CodexWatcher

________________


IV. Scroll Immutability Engine (SIE)
 Let:
I = Scroll integrity rating
S = Sigil validity score (0 or 1)
A = Audit trail score (0–1)
H = Hash match score (0–1)
Then:
SIE = (S + A + H) ÷ 3
✅ Execution permitted only if SIE ≥ 0.95
❌ Below = quarantine, block, and escalate
________________


V. Forbidden Mutation Clause
 Any scroll mutated post-binding (outside lawful process):
                  * Is quarantined to /Vaults/CorruptedScrolls/

                  * Is tagged as @Compromised

                  * Triggers LAW_08: ScrollJustice

                  * Locks the originating sigil pending review

Mutation is a reflex-level crime.
________________


VI. Reflex Repair Path
 When scroll corruption is detected due to:
                     * Manual tampering

                     * Failed rebinding

                     * Vault desync

Then:
                        * Archive original to /Vaults/Archived/

                        * Rebind lawfully with new ID

                        * Update /ScrollAuditTrail.json

                        * Append @Rebound trace tag

Manual overwrites = prohibited.
