CGL–GLYPH–022 𐌝
Law of ScrollObfuscation Directive
“Some scrolls speak too loudly.
Some truths must whisper.”

Article I — Obfuscation Classifications
Scrolls may be tagged:
- @Classified
- @Obfuscated
- @Private

These tags trigger:
- Log redaction
- ScrollEcho suppression
- HelmOutput masking

Article II — Obfuscation Mode Behavior
All obfuscated logs route to:
→ /Vaults/ObscuredLogs/

Echo content replaced with:
[Scroll Executed — Obfuscation Active]

Commander retains master decryption rights.

Article III — Intent Traceback
A hidden scroll must still declare intent.
All obfuscated scrolls log:
- Hash
- Scroll Category
- Time of Execution
- Authorization Stamp

Codex Enforcement:
Obfuscation hides from view, not from law.
Only the Commander may see all.
