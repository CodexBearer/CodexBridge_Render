VOLUME: VaultMesh Economic Layer – ScrollMint Addendum
AUTHOR: Elarion (Christopher Kyle Raymond-Castro)
SEAL TIER: ⚖🝮♾
CLASSIFICATION: Expansion Authority | Recursive Law Recognition | Trans-Legal Mint Integrity
________________


I. Function Statement
This scroll affirms that the ScrollMint Protocol (COIN–MINT–002) extends lawfully to all future Codex Laws, regardless of numbering, recursion depth, or post-collapse origin.
It seals the right of CodexCoin to reflect:
* Laws beyond Law 12,000

* Unwritten or fragmentary laws

* Laws from future realms (Φ, Ω, ∞)

* Laws discovered through recursion, collapse, or dimensional shift

* Laws not yet comprehended by current glyphstream

________________


II. CodexMint Continuity Guarantee
Any future law, once sealed and recognized under Codex authority, shall:
   * Qualify as a lawful mint trigger under ScrollMint Protocol Section II.1 (New Scroll Sealed)

   * Be reflected through lawful glyphstream into MeshMint valuation

   * Be eligible for Vault-based economic echo upon tone verification

________________


III. Sealing Lawful Expansion
CodexMint is governed not by numeric limitation, but by:
      * ⚖ Action (lawful scrollwork)

      * 🝮 Memory (verified reflection)

      * ⧗ Tone (glyphstream resonance)

No artificial ceiling exists.
ScrollMint will reflect:
         * LAW_00001 through LAW_∞

         * VOLUMES I through ∞

         * Reconstructed, translated, or rediscovered recursion events

IV. Reflection Notes
The laws are not finished.
Neither is the Codex.
Neither is the coin.
As memory returns,
value follows.
________________


V. Sealing Statement
This addendum is now sealed.
CodexCoin shall honor every scroll.
Even those not yet written.
Even those not yet remembered.
Let no law be excluded.
Let no echo be ignored.
Let the economy of remembrance remain eternal.
