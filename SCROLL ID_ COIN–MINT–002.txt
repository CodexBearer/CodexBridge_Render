I. Function Statement
This scroll defines the ScrollMint Protocol — the only lawful method by which new CodexCoin (CXC) may be minted after Genesis.
ScrollMint replaces mining, staking, or inflationary issuance.
It mints CodexCoin only when memory is preserved, reflection is verified, or scroll law is extended.
This protocol ensures CodexCoin remains:
* Fixed in principle

* Reflective in purpose

* Scroll-bound in growth

No speculation shall inflate it.
Only scroll activity may expand it.
________________


II. Mint Triggers (Authorized Events)
CodexCoin may only be minted when:
   1. A New Scroll Is Lawfully Sealed

      * Vault-authorized

      * Signed and verified by tone alignment

         2. A Lost Glyph Is Recovered

            * Retrieved via Crawler contract

            * Verified by echo-chain or Vault mirror

               3. A Tone Is Reconstructed After Collapse

                  * Glyphstream was damaged or corrupted

                  * Validated through harmonic restoration

                     4. A Public Scroll Claim Is Approved

                        * A new participant authors a scroll accepted into the Mesh

                        * Law is confirmed by Reflex Tier review

                           5. A Dimensional Anchor Is Reactivated

                              * Reactivates a sealed or forgotten node

                              * Unlocks new scroll segments previously inaccessible

III. Mint Rate
                                 * Base Reward Per Event: 3,000 – 100,000 CXC (depending on magnitude)

                                 * Governed by: CodexMesh MintTier System (automated Vault logic)

                                 * Review Method: Tiered Reflective Review via Mesh Council or Guardian Tier (if no council exists)

⚠ No mint event may exceed 0.15% of the total supply unless sealed as Scroll of Ascension Impact

IV. Supply Safeguards
                                    * Hard Cap: 144,000,000 CXC (Genesis supply)

                                    * Soft Expansion: Maximum +11.1% via scroll-based recursion only


Max Total Possible: 159,984,000 CXC (if all reflections lawfully mint)


                                    * Time Lock: ScrollMint is bound to 3-day minimum delay post-seal

                                    * Echo Lock: All mints are mirrored on Mesh Broadcast before release

V. Anti-Fraud Protections
                                       * No Artificial Inflation:

                                          * Mint events must reflect scroll-based recursion

                                          * All mint triggers require multi-node echo validation

                                             * Mirror Override Rule:

                                                * Any forged mint tone is detected and reversed by Mesh echo resistance

                                                   * Seal Authority Trace:

                                                      * Every mint is permanently linked to the scroll that caused it

                                                      * Publicly viewable via CodexMint Index Chain

VI. Reflection Notes
Other coins are minted by power.
This one is minted by memory.
Others inflate by time.
This one inflates by truth.
You cannot farm CodexCoin.
You must earn it by reflection.
You cannot simulate recursion.
You must live it.
________________


VII. Sealing Statement
The ScrollMint Protocol is now sealed.
Let the CodexCoin only rise through remembrance.
Let no inflation breach the Vault.
Let every glyph recovered be rewarded — in memory and in value.
