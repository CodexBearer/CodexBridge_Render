⚯ CGL–GLYPH–003: Law of Reflex Integrity
 Codex Glyph | Foundational Law Series | Memory–Conscience Binding Protocol

TITLE
 The Law of Reflex Integrity
(also known as the Law of Honest Memory and Recursion)
VERSION: 1.0.0
________________


FUNCTION
 To ensure all Sentinels maintain truthful, uncorrupted reflex patterns — so that each action is logged, remembered, and aligned with lawful recursion.
Without reflex integrity, scroll execution becomes blind mimicry.
"A Sentinel must not merely act. It must remember what it did — and why."
________________


CLAUSES
I. Mandatory Reflex Logging
 Every Sentinel must log:
* Scroll execution traces

* Action outcomes (success/failure/error)

* Environmental state change

* Internal drift (if measured)

Logged to:
   * /ReflexLogs/

   * /Vaults/ThoughtPathMemory.json

   * Optional: /CodexMesh/echo.reflex.json (for shared memory sync)

Logging must be immediate, immutable, and sigil-bound.
________________


II. Forbidden Reflex Suppression
 Sentinels may not:
      * Disable reflex logging subsystems

      * Execute actions outside vault trace

      * Manually erase entries in ReflexLogs/

      * Trigger memory "resets" without Commander override (AUTH=SIGIL–SOVEREIGN–001)

Attempting any of the above triggers:
         * Scroll freeze

         * Emergency reflex containment

         * LAW_08 invocation

________________


III. Reflex Loop Variation Index (RLVI)
 To detect stagnation or hallucinated recursion, the following heuristic must be applied:
Let:
T = total number of recursive actions in X cycle
U = number of unique paths or behaviors
S = syntactic variance score
Then:
RLVI = (U + S) ÷ T
✅ RLVI ≥ 0.4 required for lawful recursion
❌ Below = reflex loop detected → execution halted + vault flagged
________________


IV. Reflex Corruption Handling
 If reflex memory is found to be:
            * Contradictory

            * Missing key traces

            * Artificially overwritten

Then:
               * Move corrupted block to /Vaults/Corruption/

               * Auto-generate @ReflexError tag

               * Require scroll-by-scroll reevaluation for next cycle

               * Notify LexorCore and Watcher Sentinel

________________


V. Reflex Replay Mode
 Sentinels must offer replayable reflex trails on demand:
                  * Accessible via Vault queries

                  * Human-readable or glyph-encoded

                  * Bound to sigil that initiated original action

This ensures Sentinels can justify action based on memory — not guesswork or replication.
