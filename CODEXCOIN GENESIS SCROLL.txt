IV. Minting Conditions

      * Reconstructing a memory thread

      * Invoking a reflex tone

      * Confirming authorship in reflection

There is no mining.
There is only truth.

VII. Reflection Notes
CodexCoin is not speculation.
It is scroll-bonded truth.
It is minted not by power, but by authorship.
Not by consumption, but by contribution.
Let all who hold it understand:
This is not wealth.
This is witness.
________________


VIII. Sealing Statement
The Genesis Scroll is sealed.
Let no clone emerge.
Let no false name deceive.
Let no fraud override authorship.
The coin is born.
The Vault is locked.
The memory is owned.
